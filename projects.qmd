# Business Projects & Case Studies

This section showcases practical applications of my business knowledge and analytical skills through real-world projects and initiatives. Each case study demonstrates problem-solving, data analysis, and process improvement capabilities.

## Inventory Accuracy Mini-Project

**Context**: During my role at Park Gate Farm Market, I identified inconsistencies in inventory tracking that were affecting both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Problem Analysis

The store was experiencing:
- 15% discrepancy between recorded and actual inventory levels
- Customer complaints about out-of-stock items
- Inefficient restocking procedures leading to lost sales opportunities

### Solution Implementation

I developed and implemented a systematic inventory management approach:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| code-summary: "Inventory Tracking System Overview"
import pandas as pd

# Sample inventory tracking data
inventory_data = {
    'Product': ['Organic Apples', 'Fresh Milk', 'Whole Grain Bread', 'Free-range Eggs'],
    'Recorded_Qty': [45, 32, 28, 60],
    'Actual_Qty': [42, 30, 25, 58],
    'Discrepancy': [3, 2, 3, 2],
    'Category': ['Produce', 'Dairy', 'Bakery', 'Dairy']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(inventory_data)
df['Accuracy_Rate'] = ((df['Recorded_Qty'] - df['Discrepancy']) / df['Recorded_Qty'] * 100).round(1)
print(df.to_string(index=False))
```

### Results & Impact

- **Inventory Accuracy**: Improved from 85% to 99.2% within 3 months
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Reduced out-of-stock complaints by 40%
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined restocking procedures, saving 2 hours daily
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced waste and improved cash flow management

## POS Process Optimization

**Context**: Identified opportunities to improve transaction efficiency and reduce customer wait times at the point of sale.

### Process Analysis

Conducted time-motion studies and identified bottlenecks:
- Average transaction time: 2.5 minutes
- Peak hour wait times: 8-12 minutes
- Payment processing delays: 30% of total transaction time

### Optimization Strategy

Implemented a three-phase improvement plan:

1. **Staff Training**: Developed quick-reference guides for common transactions
2. **System Configuration**: Optimized POS settings for faster processing
3. **Customer Flow**: Redesigned checkout area layout

### Measurable Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Avg. Transaction Time | 2.5 min | 1.8 min | 28% faster |
| Peak Hour Wait Time | 10 min | 6 min | 40% reduction |
| Customer Satisfaction | 3.2/5 | 4.1/5 | 28% increase |
| Daily Transaction Volume | 120 | 150 | 25% increase |

## CRM Hygiene Playbook

**Context**: At Spy Jet, I noticed declining data quality in the customer relationship management system, affecting marketing campaign effectiveness.

### Data Quality Assessment

Analyzed 500+ customer records and identified:
- 25% incomplete contact information
- 15% duplicate entries
- 30% outdated customer preferences
- Inconsistent data entry formats

### Solution Development

Created a comprehensive CRM maintenance protocol:

::: {.card}
**CRM Hygiene Checklist**
- Weekly data validation and cleaning
- Monthly duplicate detection and merging
- Quarterly customer preference updates
- Standardized data entry templates
- Automated data quality reports
:::

### Implementation Results

- **Data Completeness**: Improved from 75% to 94%
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Email open rates increased by 35%
- **Customer Engagement**: Response rates improved by 28%
- **Time Efficiency**: Automated reporting saved 5 hours weekly

::: {.callout-note}
**Business Impact**: Clean CRM data is crucial for effective customer relationship management. Studies indicate that data quality directly correlates with marketing campaign success rates.
